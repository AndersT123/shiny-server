# golEMTEST

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of golEMTEST is to let you comptete with your friends in predicting the results of sports events.

Use the package by completing the following steps:

1. Install the package **ADD REFEENCES**
2. Create a league 
4. Add a data source
5. Have fun competing with your friends in predicting results for sports events

### Create a league

Use `create_league_r()` or `create_league_cmd()` to set up a directory structure to store user provided predictions. `create_league()_r` is run from `R` and `create_league_cmd()` is run from the terminal using `R_CMD...`

### Add a data source

You should specify a data source for your app. Whatever you specify should just return a tibble with the following fields ...

Install golEMTEST as a package. Call a function that sets up the webscraper into the global.R file.
Use golem::set_golem

Either a csv file
R program that scrapes some results

## Installation

You can install the released version of golEMTEST from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
#install.packages("golEMTEST")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
#devtools::install_github("AndersT123/shiny-server")
```
## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
#library(golEMTEST)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub!
